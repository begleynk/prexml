# Prexml - A pure Ruby XML library

Prexml aims to be an XML library implemented in pure Ruby. While gems like Nokogiri and Oga exist, they require installing native extensions which in some situations can be cumbersome to deal with. The Ruby standard library includes an XML library, REXML, but its documentation and support are seriously lacking.

Prexml aims to be your XML library of choice when you don't want to deal with native extensions, and speed of processing is not your first concern.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'prexml'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install prexml

## Usage

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
